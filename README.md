## Accessible Calendar App

This application is to demonstrate a use case of building a calendar app that meets WCAG 2.2 standards.

Using my accessibility heuristic method, I will create a Figma design with accessibility notation and develop the interface to be accessible.

My heuristic accessibility method is as follows:

| Category              | Description                                                                                                                    |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Keyboard Interaction  | Ensure that all interactive elements are accessible and operable via keyboard without any keyboard traps.                      |
| Meaningful Content    | Ensure errors and important information are clearly described in text.                                                         |
| Page Structure        | Ensure that the structure and functionality of the page are logically organized for easy navigation and interaction.           |
| Readability           | Ensure that text content is readable and understandable, providing error correction suggestions when needed.                   |
| Screen Reader Support | Ensure that all non-text content is identifiable and correctly labeled for screen readers.                                     |
| User QOL              | Ensure that the interface design accommodates user preferences and needs, such as large target areas for interactive elements. |
